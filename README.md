a harmonic series aggregator 

for norns w/grid


<a href="https://youtu.be/SwtadkessjA?si=uh_lT5BKscTG2Giv"> video performance/tutorial </a>

here are some of the key combos that are not in the video, but may be helpful

* K1 + Enc 2 = main buffer Record amplitude
  
  [ indicated on screen by the bg square color ]
  
  will effect how loud the harmonics will be recorded to the buffer.

* K1 + Enc 3 = buffer Preserve amplitude
  
  [ indicated on screen by the size of the circle ]

  will efffect how long the decay of the delay is

* K1 + Enc 1 = main buffer Amplitude

  [ indicated on screen by the color inside the circle ]

  control the overall volume of the recorded buffers



the following allows for quick controls over the buffer length, ( performed in video around 8:06 )

* K2 = set Loop start

* K3 = set Loop end

* K2 (long press > 1 sec) = clears loop length and restores default length set in params menu



for quick reference here are some controls mentioned in the video

* Enc 1 = buffer playback rate
  
  [ indicated on screen by the size of the bg square ]
  
  the rate is quantized to the scale selected for the synth, set in the params menu. Can also adjust the rate slew.

* Enc 2 = synth filter Q factor
  
  [ indicated on screen by thickness of randomly drawn lines ]

  defaults to max value (highets Q factor) turn CW to reduce Q factor

* Enc 3 = softcut filter cutoff frequency of main buffer

  [ indicated on screen by the thickness of the circles border ]

  This filter is quantized to the scale selected for the synth, set in the params menu. This means you will get stepped filter sweeps. Which is an effect I enjoy.

Here is a map of the grid layout
